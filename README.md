# CustomGit
A custom-coded Git implementation in C++ for my robotics physics engine.

This isn’t really a very good Git handler, but to have a bit more control over my versions and servers, I created my own Git. This is probably the Git that is going to be used for many of my projects, and I plan to add improvements when I need them.

If you would like to run this, it only works on Windows 10–11, and you need a home server as well as Visual Studio.
